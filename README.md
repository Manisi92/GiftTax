A gift is a transfer of property to another person against no compensation or payment. If the total value of the gifts you receive from the same donor in the course of 3 years is €5,000 or more, you must pay gift tax.

When a gift is given by a close relative or a family member, the amount of gift tax is determined by the following table (source vero.fi):

Value of gift	Tax at the lower limit	Tax rate(%) for exceeding part
5 000 — 25 000	  100	        8
25 000 — 55 000	  1 700	      10
55 000 — 200 000	4 700	      12
200 000 — 1 000 000	  22 100	  15
1 000 000 —	          142 100	      17
